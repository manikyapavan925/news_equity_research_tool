## 🎯 **LLM Response Issues FIXED!**

### ❌ **Previous Issues:**
1. **Repetitive responses**: "The purpose of the article is to provide information about AI plans... [repeated 20 times]"
2. **Incomplete responses**: "Microsoft's AI strategies for 2026" with no actual content
3. **Nonsensical short responses**: "tariff concerns" or "data" for AI questions
4. **Just repeating article content** instead of analyzing it

### ✅ **Solutions Implemented:**

#### 1. **Enhanced Prompt Engineering**
- **Smarter prompts** that explicitly instruct the LLM how to respond
- **Question-type specific prompts** for AI/tech vs financial vs general questions
- **Clear instructions** to state when information isn't available

#### 2. **Intelligent Response Detection**
- **Repetition detection**: Catches when LLM gets stuck in loops
- **Poor response detection**: Identifies short, nonsensical, or copied responses
- **Quality checks**: Ensures responses are meaningful and helpful

#### 3. **Professional Fallback System**
When LLM fails, the system now provides:
