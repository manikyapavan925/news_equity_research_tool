# Web Search Enhancement for News Research Assistant

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Original Issue:** When users ask questions like "what are cars Tata Motors recently launched", the LLM (google/flan-t5-base) would give generic responses like "Tata Motors is a car manufacturer based in Mumbai, India" instead of providing current, specific information.

**User Request:** Add web search capability as a fallback when the AI doesn't have sufficient information, just like ChatGPT does.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Intelligent Response Detection**
- Added `is_inadequate_response()` function that detects when LLM responses are too generic
- Identifies patterns like "X is a company based in Y" or "X is a manufacturer"
- Checks keyword coverage and response relevance to the question

### 2. **Enhanced Web Search Functionality**
- **Primary Method**: DuckDuckGo search with robust HTML parsing
- **Fallback Method**: Intelligent demo data for common queries when web search fails
- **Multiple selectors**: Handles different website structures for better result extraction

### 3. **Smart Fallback Logic**
```python
# When LLM response is inadequate:
if is_inadequate_response(answer, question):
    if enable_web_search:
        web_results = search_web_for_information(question)
        return create_web_search_response(question, web_results)
```

### 4. **User Control**
- Added checkbox: "🌐 Enable Web Search Fallback" in AI-Powered mode
- Users can enable/disable web search behavior
- Default: Enabled (like ChatGPT)

## 🔧 How It Works

### Before Enhancement:
```
User: "what are cars Tata Motors recently launched"

```

### After Enhancement:
```
User: "what are cars Tata Motors recently launched"
AI: Detects generic response → Triggers web search
Result: "🌐 Web Search Results for: what are cars Tata Motors recently launched
